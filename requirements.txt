# Angry AI - FreeBSD Code Reviewer
# Minimal dependencies for cross-platform support (including FreeBSD)

# YAML config parsing (pure Python, works everywhere)
PyYAML>=6.0

# That's it! Everything else uses Python standard library:
# - urllib for HTTP requests to Ollama
# - json for API communication
# - subprocess for build execution
# - pathlib for file operations
# - logging for output
# - re for parsing
# - dataclasses for data structures

# NOTE: This project does NOT require:
# - torch (GPU-dependent, not available on FreeBSD)
# - transformers (requires torch)
# - requests (we use urllib to minimize dependencies)
# - numpy (not needed for this application)
#
# The AI model runs on a REMOTE Ollama server, not locally.
# This script just needs to make HTTP requests and parse responses.
